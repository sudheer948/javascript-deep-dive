# JavaScript Deep Dive

This repository documents my deep exploration of JavaScript internals,
language behavior, and advanced patterns.

## Modules

- scope-closures
- event-loop (coming next)
- prototypes-this (planned)
- async-patterns (planned)
- functional-immutability (planned)
- testing-debugging (planned)

Each folder focuses on understanding core language mechanics
with implementation examples.
